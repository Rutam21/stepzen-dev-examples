# StepZen Example: `with-rss`

## Introduction

This project builds a GraphQL API connected to a RSS Feed using StepZen. We will use the `@rest` directive to generate our GraphQL schema.

## Getting Started

You'll need to create a [StepZen account](https://stepzen.com/request-invite) first. Once you've got that set up, [git clone](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/setting-up-a-repository/git-clone) this repository onto your machine and open the working directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/stepzen-dev/examples.git
cd examples/with-rss
```

Before you can run this example, you need to have a RSS Feed. If you don't have a RSS Feed you could use the Medium RSS Feed that can be found at `https://medium.com/feed/YOUR_USERNAME` (or try `https://medium.com/feed/@roy-derks`).

## Run StepZen

Open your terminal and [install the StepZen CLI](https://stepzen.com/docs/quick-start):

```bash
npm install -g stepzen
```

You need to login here using the command:

```bash
stepzen login
```

After you've installed the CLI and logged in, run:

```bash
stepzen start
```

A proxy of the GraphiQL playground becomes available at `http://localhost/5001` (in example `http://localhost:5001/api/with-rss`), which you can use to explore the GraphQL API. Also, the endpoint at which your GraphQL API is deployed gets logged in the terminal. You can query your GraphQL API from any application, browser, or IDE by providing the API Key linked to your account.
