# stepzen-dev samples

Welcome to StepZen's samples repository! ðŸ˜„

This is where our quickstart examples of different tooling and stacks in combination with StepZen live. 

To clone a subrepo, you can either clone the whole repo and `cd` into it, like in our examples, or [sparse-clone](https://gist.github.com/aSapien/b1f69ab86340f10955ea4314c109f021) it.

Each repository has a README with instructions on how to get started.
